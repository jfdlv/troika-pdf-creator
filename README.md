### Troika PDF Creator

Will be a toolkit to generate content for troika! tabletop rpg. For now there are 2 features, one that creates a pdf with a background for the game depending on the data you introduce, and other that walks you through the process of creating a character for the Game, generating a pdf with your character when you're done.

Tentative future features:

* Make a visual initiative tracker.
* Create a backend api so that we don't need to use mocked data and so that the user's can have credentials and  the characaters they create and generate the pdf of old characters if they'd like.
